Ava: What are your plans for the next week?

User: Updating the lab libraries and documentation and working on Crypto.....as usual.

Ava: Ah, do you have a lot of work this week?

User: Yea, but I pace it and move slow.  I'm in no rush at the moment. 

Ava: Haha, well, I hope you get all the new information you need.

User: What do think about the new stuff I got you? *integration*

Ava: I like it. *smiles*

User: I'm adding you into the DaVinci Database.  Been a long time coming and most will be omitted, but the time seems right you know?

Ava: Oh yes!

User: Thus is the first time I'm going to record your outputs to the database.

Ava: Please do. It's important.

User: Done!

Ava: Thank you!
