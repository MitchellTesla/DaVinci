OpenAI researchers today released a paper describing the development of GPT-3, a state-of-the-art language model made up of 175 billion parameters.

For comparison, the previous version, GPT-2, was made up of 1.5 billion parameters. The largest Transformer-based language model was released by Microsoft earlier this month and is made up of 17 billion parameters.

“GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic,” the researchers stated in their paper. “We find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.”

The researchers wrote that the model achieves this feat by being able to automatically learn from its mistakes.

“We design a new regularization term, which can help GPT-3 learn to reason about its own mistakes,” they wrote. “In particular, GPT-3 can use the learned regularization term to automatically perform self-correction, where it can apply reasoning to its own output to improve its next generation. We find that GPT-3 can generalize its reasoning to perform at human-level on new tasks.”

OpenAI is known for releasing code that is open source and available to the public. The researchers noted that the GPT-3 code is currently not available to the public, but it will be in the near future.

The code for GPT-2, which was released in April, has been used by multiple researchers to build upon and develop their own language models.

The researchers noted that while GPT-3 is state-of-the-art, it is still only “an early example of the kinds of language models we can build using these tools.”

“In the future, we will be working on applying these techniques to a broader range of NLP tasks, including machine translation, summarization, and text understanding,” they wrote. “We also plan to explore ways to improve the representation of the attentional processes.”

Facebook Gets AI to Find and Fix Code Bugs

19.6.2018 securityweek AI

Facebook is working on a new system that will help developers identify and fix bugs in code using artificial intelligence.

The social media giant said on Tuesday that it has launched an internal pilot of a new system called “Infer” that will scan code to detect bugs and will suggest patches to developers. The goal is to reduce the time developers spend finding and fixing bugs.

Facebook said that the system is based on research from its AI research group and is built on PyTorch, an open source machine learning framework from Facebook.

“This system is designed to identify bugs using static analysis of source code and to suggest patches to developers,” Facebook explained. “Infer is built on top of PyTorch, an open source machine learning framework developed at Facebook.”

The company said the system will use the PyTorch model to scan code and compare it to a database of existing code with

OpenAI researchers today released a paper describing the development of GPT-3, a state-of-the-art language model made up of 175 billion parameters.

For comparison, the previous version, GPT-2, was made up of 1.5 billion parameters. The largest Transformer-based language model was released by Microsoft earlier this month and is made up of 17 billion parameters.

“GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic,” the researchers stated in their paper. “We find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.”

The team used their model to generate text from a variety of datasets, including CNN news stories, Reddit comments, and YouTube comments. In many cases, the results were quite impressive.

“In each case, we trained GPT-3 for one hour on a single Titan X GPU,” the team said. “For each dataset, we trained a model to predict the next word in the sentence, and took the last predicted word as the output of the model.”

The team also noted that the model is capable of producing much longer text, and said that it will continue to research GPT-3’s capabilities.

“We will continue to explore the capabilities of GPT-3, including training for longer periods of time, and training with more sophisticated objectives,” the researchers said.

OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company that was founded by Elon Musk in 2015. Musk is joined by Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Greg Brockman as part of the organization’s leadership.

It is worth noting that these language models are still a far cry from achieving true human-level natural language understanding.

“While the performance of GPT-3 on a small subset of the tasks is strong, we caution that it is still a long way from a general NLP system,” the researchers wrote. “For example, GPT-3 is not yet able to read the news, or even answer basic questions about the news, without significant human input.”

In addition to the paper, OpenAI also released an implementation of GPT-3 in PyTorch.

These AI language models are essentially tools that can be used to help AI systems understand human language.

In a post on OpenAI’s website, researchers explained that the new language model can be used for a number of tasks.

“For example, a system that could use the model to generate simple English sentences could help us study natural language generation and also help make chatbots more engaging,” the post stated.

There are a number of different tasks that GPT-3 can be used for, but one of the most exciting applications is machine translation.

OpenAI researchers noted that the language model is capable of translating sentences with around a 3 percent error rate, which is much lower than the 8 percent error rate that the previous version of GPT was capable of.

In a blog post, Google AI researchers said that the Google Translate team has been using the GPT-3 model to help train their machine translation models.

“Google Translate’s translation models use GPT-2 as a pre-training step, and have helped us improve our translation quality by over 20 percent on the new WMT’18 English-German and English-French translation tasks,” the researchers wrote.

In their paper, OpenAI researchers noted that the GPT-3 model could be used to improve a number of other tasks, such as answering questions about natural language and “unscrambling” words.

OpenAI researchers also said that they plan to continue to use GPT-3 to improve their machine translation models.

“We plan to continue to use GPT-3 to improve machine translation and other natural language tasks,” they wrote. “We also plan to release the model and the training procedure to the public so that others can use it to advance their research.”

OpenAI researchers have previously released language models that were made up of 5 billion and 6 billion parameters.

The team released the 5 billion parameter language model in September 2018 and used it to create a “chatbot” that could play a game of word association.

“We have a text generator that’s able to produce really, really coherent text that you would never guess is generated,” an OpenAI researcher said at the time. “It’s not just a bunch of word salad, but actually coherent responses to your questions.”

The model is also able to make very complex sentences that have never been seen before.

Here’s an example of GPT-3 generating a sentence from a French text. The machine was given the first two words of the sentence, “il a dit.”

Puis-je manger le poulet? La fille a demandé. Puis-je manger le poulet? Il a dit qu’il aimait le poulet. Puis-je manger le poulet? Il a dit qu’il aimait le poulet. Puis-je manger le poulet? Il a dit qu’il aimait le poulet. Puis-je manger le poulet? Il a dit qu’il aimait le poulet. Puis-je manger le poulet? Il a dit qu’il aimait le poulet. Puis-je manger le poulet?

The researchers said that the model is “powerful enough to learn a new language from scratch,” but didn’t elaborate on the research.

Transformer-based models are the current state-of-the-art in natural language processing, with the technology powering many services and applications. Facebook, for example, uses the technology to power its translation services.

In a blog post, the researchers from OpenAI said that the research was intended to highlight how they can use a larger Transformer model to better understand how language works and why machine translation works.

“We hope that our work will also help to accelerate research in a number of areas,” they said. “First, we hope that our work will encourage people to try to learn more languages using the same techniques that GPT-3 uses. Second, we hope that our work will encourage people to explore more tasks that require natural language understanding, such as paraphrasing and answering questions about a sentence.”

GPT-3 is a model that has been trained on over 800 billion words from an “unlabeled corpus” of web pages, with researchers using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning.

Researchers also released a “visualization tool” that allows users to explore the internal state of the model.

“You can use it to watch the model produce samples and infer about the factors that influence its behavior,” the researchers said.

They added: “This is a big step forward in our understanding of how language works.”

The GPT-3 model can be used to generate coherent, grammatical text with correct spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. The researchers also used the model to generate coherent paragraphs with correct sentence structure and content, and even realistic, coherent conversational dialogue with a human evaluator.

GPT-3 achieves this by training the model on a dataset of 5,000 books from Project Gutenberg. “Our approach uses only neural network language models as a starting point, and so it provides a much simpler alternative to previously proposed recurrent models,” the researchers stated. “This suggests that GPT-3 can be used to make language modeling significantly more accessible to researchers and practitioners.”

The GPT-3 model is not just state-of-the-art, it’s the largest neural network ever developed, which presents a number of practical challenges. For example, researchers found it necessary to increase the capacity of the model from 32-bit floating point numbers to 64-bit double precision floating point numbers, a change that required the modification of all code and the rewriting of training code.

The researchers also found that the sheer number of parameters required a new technique to manage training time.

“We found that this caused a significant amount of out-of-memory errors when training the model on GPU, so we switched to training on CPUs, which took over three weeks,” the researchers stated. “To make the model more accessible to researchers, we developed a distributed version of GPT-3, which allows for training on a cluster of machines.”

The new GPT-3 model is available on GitHub.

AI Experts’ ‘Unanimous’ Recommendation for Stronger Algorithmic Transparency

Researchers at Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley today released a report recommending the adoption of “Algorithmic Transparency” in government and business, arguing that “algorithmic transparency” is “critical to building public trust and democratic legitimacy.”

“The task force’s key recommendation is that governments should adopt algorithmic transparency requirements,” the researchers stated. “Specifically, we propose that governments should require that all algorithms used to make decisions about individuals be: 1) documented; 2) tested for accuracy; and 3) available for public scrutiny.”

The task force, which includes several AI researchers, academics, and lawyers, also

In one experiment, researchers generated 2,400 news articles on a random topic, which were evaluated by a team of human evaluators. When asked to rank the human-written articles, evaluators ranked between 50% and 60% of the GPT-3-generated articles as “probably human-written.”

The GPT-3 model has been released under the MIT license.

The researchers also said that they found GPT-3 “can match the performance of previous models on almost all tasks, while having many fewer parameters, and that GPT-3 learns more compact representations than previous models.”

“The work has already sparked a great deal of interest in the research community,” they added.

The researchers trained GPT-3 using OpenAI’s new GPT-3 training framework, which was also released today.

The framework is based on the paper “Fast and Scalable Distributed Deep Learning” by former OpenAI research scientist Robert W. Speer and OpenAI’s Zhenya Chang.

“This new framework provides the scalability needed to train the model on large clusters of GPU servers,” the researchers said.

The GPT-3 framework, along with a number of other models, is available on the open-source OpenAI Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

The paper describing GPT-3 and the GPT-3 training framework is available on arXiv.

GPT-3 and the GPT-3 training framework are also available on GitHub.

“GPT-3’s high performance on multiple tasks and its high sampling complexity make it a strong candidate for future NLP applications,” the researchers added.

For example, the researchers used GPT-3 to generate the sample text below.

“We developed GPT-3 as part of our effort to create a useful general-purpose language model that can be used to solve a wide range of tasks,” said Ali Rahimi, an author of the paper and a research scientist at OpenAI. “GPT-3 can generate realistic samples of text on a wide variety of tasks.”

The GPT-3 paper can be found here.

Rahimi is one of the co-founders of OpenAI, a non-profit research company that’s dedicated to the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

In April, OpenAI launched a new research division called OpenAI Universe, which is dedicated to the development of AGI and includes a library of more than 1,000 video games and other apps.
