The quality of the text generated by GPT-3 is so high that it is difficult to distinguish from that written by a human, which has both benefits and risks. Thirty-one OpenAI researchers and engineers presented the original May 28, 2020 paper introducing GPT-3. 
In their paper, they warned of GPT-3's potential dangers and called for research to mitigate risk.[1]:34 David Chalmers, an Australian philosopher, described GPT-3 as "one of the most interesting and important AI systems ever produced."

Microsoft announced on September 22, 2020 that it had licensed "exclusive" use of GPT-3; others can still use the public API to receive output, but only Microsoft has control of the source code.
Hence, the creation and implementation of a modified GPT-3 MODEL to GPT-4 is also included in this repository.
